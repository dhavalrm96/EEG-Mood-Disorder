his tells Git to ignore all the files and folders we don't want to upload.

1. Ignore all data file types

*.mat
*.fif
*.csv

2. Ignore all plot/image files

*.png
*.jpg
*.jpeg

3. Ignore the data folders by name

The "/" at the end means it's a folder

"EEG Data"/
filtered_EEG_data/
plot_outputs/

4. Ignore Python and Jupyter cache files

pycache/
.ipynb_checkpoints/
